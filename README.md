# What is this?

This set of scripts generates a rough categorization of my expenses. I wrote it mainly for fun and to understand a little better where
all of my money is going. It generates a XLSX file that I use to create the visualizations I use to analyze the results.


The other intention of this project is to tinker with the CSV API and the RubyXL gem.

## How to run the script?

`clear && ruby expense_report.rb "/path/to/csvs/*.csv" '/path/to/report.xlsx'`
